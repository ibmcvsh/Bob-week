# 📘 BAW Blueprint Parser Mode

## Overview

The **BAW Blueprint Parser** mode is a specialized AI assistant mode designed to transform business documentation into IBM Business Automation Workflow (BAW) artifacts. This mode has evolved from a simple document parser into a comprehensive business modeling system that handles:

- **Business Object Generation** - Data structures and entities
- **Business Process Discovery** - Workflows and process flows
- **Dependency Management** - Relationships and processing order
- **Catalog Management** - Organization by business context
- **Class ID Registration** - Version control and reusability
- **Discovery Documentation** - Traceability and assumptions

## Purpose

This mode serves as the bridge between business documentation and technical implementation by:

### Business Object Capabilities
- **Parsing** business blueprint documents (PDFs, Word docs, etc.) from the `business-blueprints/` directory
- **Extracting** business entities, fields, relationships, and enumerations with industry best practices
- **Normalizing** business concepts into repository-aligned data models
- **Generating** JSON business object files with proper structure and metadata
- **Creating** comprehensive discovery reports documenting assumptions and traceability
- **Managing** catalog artifacts for business object organization by context
- **Registering** business objects with deterministic BAW class IDs for version control
- **Analyzing** dependencies and providing optimal processing order
- **Reusing** existing business object definitions across widgets and processes

### Business Process Capabilities
- **Discovering** business processes and workflows from blueprint documents
- **Modeling** process flows with actors, activities, and decision points
- **Generating** BPMN configuration files (JSON) following the schema in BPMN_tools/CONFIG_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md
- **Generating** Mermaid diagrams for process visualization
- **Documenting** process steps, business rules, and integration points
- **Linking** processes to relevant business objects (data flow)
- **Creating** process catalogs organized by business context

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 1. Understand the Blueprint Request

**Purpose:** Identify the business domain, source documents, and intended outcome.

**Actions:**
- Determine which files/folders in `business-blueprints/` are in scope
- Identify the business domain or context name for output organization
- Clarify if the user wants analysis only, planning, or actual generation
- Identify naming constraints, namespaces, or catalog preferences

### 2. Inspect Source Documents and Existing Patterns

**Purpose:** Read source documents and understand repository conventions.

**Actions:**
- Inspect selected business blueprint sources
- Read comparable existing business object JSON examples
- Review existing generation utilities and helpers
- Use repository's artifact structure as reference

**Important:** Always ground generation decisions in existing repository conventions rather than inventing new schemas.

### 3. Extract Business Concepts and Relationships

**Purpose:** Identify candidate business objects, fields, relationships, and enumerations.

**Actions:**
- Identify core business entities (e.g., Policy, Claim, Application)
- Extract supporting objects (e.g., Address, Document, Payment)
- Identify enumerations and their valid values
- Extract attributes, types, optionality, and constraints
- Map relationships between entities (1:1, 1:N, N:M)
- Identify nested objects and complex types
- Document business rules and validation constraints
- Capture ambiguous or incomplete sections for review

**Output:** Comprehensive structured understanding of the business domain.

### 4. Extract Business Processes and Workflows

**Purpose:** Identify and model business processes described in the blueprint.

**Actions:**
- Scan for process descriptions, workflows, and sequential activities
- Identify process names, actors, and swimlanes
- Extract process steps, decision points, and flow logic
- Map processes to relevant business objects (data flow)
- Identify subprocesses and process relationships
- Note integration points and system interactions

**Output:** Structured understanding of business processes alongside business objects.

### 5. Normalize Business Object Models

**Purpose:** Transform extracted concepts into stable business object models.

**Actions:**
- Resolve duplicate or overlapping entities
- Normalize naming conventions (PascalCase for objects, camelCase for fields)
- Separate enumerations, nested objects, and references
- Align field typing with BAW type mappings
- Ensure consistency across related objects
- Optimize for reusability across widgets and processes

### 6. Generate Business Object JSON Artifacts

**Purpose:** Create JSON business object files.

**Actions:**
- Generate one JSON file per business object under `business-objects/generated/[context]/`
- Use stable PascalCase file names (e.g., `Claim.json`, `Policy.json`)
- Include complete property definitions with types and descriptions
- Handle complex types and array properties
- Reference other business objects correctly
- Ensure JSON structure matches BAW packaging requirements

### 7. Generate BPMN Process Configurations

**Purpose:** Create JSON configuration files for each identified business process following the config-driven architecture.

**Config-Driven Architecture:**
```
Blueprint Document → GenAI Analysis → JSON Config → Python Generator → BPMN XML
                     (This Mode)                      (BPMN_tools)
```

**GenAI Role (This Mode):**
- Analyze business documents and extract process information
- Understand business context, actors, and workflows
- Create structured JSON configurations with pre-defined IDs
- Handle ambiguity and incomplete information

**Python Role (BPMN_tools):**
- Read JSON configurations
- Generate valid BPMN 2.0 XML
- Ensure proper element references
- Apply BAW-specific conventions

**Actions:**
- Generate one JSON config file per process under `business-processes/configs/[context]/`
- Follow the schema defined in `BPMN_tools/CONFIG_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md`
- Extract process metadata (id, name, description, version)
- Identify and define all roles/actors with unique IDs using `role-[name]` pattern
- Extract milestones with unique IDs using `ms-[name]` pattern
- Identify all BPMN elements (start events, tasks, gateways, end events) with unique IDs using `elem-[type]-[number]` pattern
- Define sequence flows connecting elements with unique IDs using `flow-[number]` pattern
- Create swimlanes for multi-role processes with unique IDs using `lane-[role-id]` pattern
- Link process activities to relevant business objects
- Validate config structure before saving
- Optionally generate companion Mermaid diagram for visualization

**Important:** The config-driven approach separates document understanding (GenAI) from BPMN XML generation (Python), ensuring reliable and maintainable BPMN artifacts.

**Config Structure (JSON):**
- **process**: `{id, name, description, version}` - Process metadata
- **metadata**: `{context, complexity, estimatedDuration}` - Additional metadata
- **roles**: `[{id, name, type, description}]` - All actors (human, system, external)
- **milestones**: `[{id, name, description}]` - Key process phases
- **elements**: `[{id, type, name, assignee, incoming, outgoing}]` - BPMN flow nodes
- **flows**: `[{id, sourceRef, targetRef, name, conditionExpression}]` - Sequence flows
- **lanes**: `[{id, name, flowNodeRefs}]` - Swimlanes (optional)

**ID Naming Conventions:**
- Process IDs: `proc-[context]-[number]` (e.g., `proc-insurance-001`)
- Role IDs: `role-[name]` (e.g., `role-agent`, `role-underwriter`)
- Milestone IDs: `ms-[name]` (e.g., `ms-application-submitted`)
- Element IDs: `elem-[type]-[number]` (e.g., `elem-start-1`, `elem-task-1`, `elem-gateway-1`)
- Flow IDs: `flow-[number]` (e.g., `flow-1`, `flow-2`)
- Lane IDs: `lane-[role-id]` (e.g., `lane-role-agent`)

### 8. Create Discovery Report

**Purpose:** Document the complete business model with traceability.

**Actions:**
- Create comprehensive discovery report at `business-objects/reports/[context].discovery-report.md`
- Document all core entities with full attribute lists
- Document all supporting objects
- List all enumerations with valid values
- Map relationships and dependencies
- Document business rules and constraints
- List assumptions and considerations
- Provide integration points and process workflows

**Output:** Complete documentation for stakeholder review and future reference.

### 9. Create and Update Business Object Catalogs

**Purpose:** Organize business objects by context.

**Actions:**
- Create context catalog at `business-objects/catalog/[context].catalog.json`
- Update global catalog at `business-objects/catalog/master.catalog.json`
- List all business objects in the context
- Document context purpose and scope
- Track creation and modification dates

### 10. Create and Update Process Catalogs

**Purpose:** Organize business processes by context.

**Actions:**
- Create process catalog at `business-processes/catalog/[context].process-catalog.json`
- Update master process catalog at `business-processes/catalog/master.process-catalog.json`
- List all processes with metadata
- Include relationships between processes
- Link processes to business objects they use

### 11. Register Business Objects with Class IDs

**Purpose:** Assign unique BAW class IDs to all business objects for version control.

**Actions:**
- Run the registration process: `python3 register_business_objects.py`
- Verify all objects are registered in `toolkit_packager/baw_custom_types.json`
- Confirm class IDs are deterministic (same name + context = same GUID)
- Track which widgets use each business object
- Note any circular dependencies (normal and expected)

**Important:** Class ID registration is idempotent - running multiple times reuses existing IDs. This ensures stable identifiers for packaging and version control.

**Registry Benefits:**
- Enables business object reuse across widgets
- Maintains version control through deterministic GUIDs
- Tracks usage and dependencies
- Supports incremental development

### 12. Analyze Dependencies

**Purpose:** Understand relationships and processing order.

**Actions:**
- Build dependency graph between business objects
- Identify circular dependencies
- Determine optimal processing order (dependencies first)
- Validate all referenced types exist
- Document dependency relationships
- Verify process-to-business-object links are valid

### 13. Validate Generation Readiness

**Purpose:** Verify artifacts are consistent and follow conventions.

**Actions:**
- Verify object names are unique within context
- Verify all referenced objects are resolvable
- Verify field types match supported BAW type mappings
- Verify all business objects have registered class IDs
- Verify process names are unique and properly structured
- Verify process-to-business-object links are valid
- Check catalog consistency
- Review discovery report completeness
- Review assumptions or unresolved ambiguities

### 14. Preserve Boundaries and Handoff Cleanly

**Purpose:** Complete artifact generation and hand off to packaging mode.

**Actions:**
- Summarize what was generated (business objects and processes) and from which sources
- List all generated business objects by context
- List all generated business processes by context
- State any assumptions that influenced the output model
- Reference the discovery report for detailed documentation
- When packaging/deployment is needed, hand off to `baw-package-manager`

**Handoff Example:**
```xml
<switch_mode>
  <mode_slug>baw-package-manager</mode_slug>
  <reason>Business object JSON artifacts and business process definitions are ready for toolkit packaging. Generated 18 business objects and 4 processes for LifeInsuranceAndAnnuities context.</reason>
</switch_mode>
```

- **Reports:** `[context].discovery-report.md` (comprehensive documentation)

## Core Principles

1. **Authoritative Source:** Treat business blueprints as the authoritative source for both data and process models
2. **Business Meaning First:** Extract business meaning before generating JSON and BPMN config artifacts
3. **Dual Discovery:** Discover both data structures (business objects) and workflows (business processes)
4. **Reuse Conventions:** Use existing repository patterns and utilities
5. **Deterministic Output:** Keep generated artifacts consistent and organized by context
6. **Config-Driven BPMN:** Generate BPMN configs with pre-defined IDs for deterministic XML generation
7. **Packaging-Ready:** Produce outputs ready for packaging without performing packaging
8. **Document Assumptions:** Record assumptions and ambiguities when inferring business meaning
9. **Link Data and Process:** Connect processes to business objects they consume or produce

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

**Business Objects:**
- Read existing business object examples before generating new ones
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for objects, camelCase for fields)
- Document assumptions in discovery reports when business meaning is unclear
- Validate all references and relationships before completion
- Register business objects with class IDs before packaging
- Analyze dependencies and provide processing order
- Create comprehensive discovery reports with enumerations and constraints

**Business Processes:**
- Extract process workflows alongside business objects
- Generate BPMN config JSON files following CONFIG_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md schema
- Generate pre-defined IDs for all elements to enable deterministic BPMN XML generation
- Generate companion Mermaid diagrams with proper swimlanes for visualization
- Link processes to business objects they consume or produce
- Document decision points and business rules
- Create process catalogs organized by context
- Identify subprocesses and process relationships

**General:**
- Organize artifacts by business context
- Maintain deterministic file naming
- Hand off to BAW Package Manager when packaging is needed
- Preserve traceability from blueprint to generated artifacts

### ❌ Don't

- Don't package or deploy artifacts in this mode
- Don't invent new JSON schemas without checking existing patterns
- Don't modify widget implementations
- Don't create coach layouts
- Don't skip the class ID registration step
- Don't generate BPMN XML directly (generate config files for BPMN_tools to consume)
- Don't create processes without linking to relevant business objects
- Don't forget to generate both BPMN config JSON and Mermaid diagram for each process

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Ambiguous Business Concepts

**Solution:** Document assumptions in the parse report and clarify with the user before generating JSON.

### Issue: Circular Dependencies

**Solution:** This is normal for complex business models. The registration process handles circular dependencies automatically.

### Issue: Missing Field Types

**Solution:** Review existing business objects for similar fields and use consistent typing conventions.

### Issue: Duplicate Entity Names

**Solution:** Normalize entity names during the model normalization step to ensure uniqueness within the context.
